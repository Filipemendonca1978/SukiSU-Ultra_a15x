# SukiSU-Ultra

A kernel-based root solution for Android devices, forked from [`tiann/KernelSU`](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), and added some interesting changes.

# To build:
- Download kernel from Samsung Open-Source website
- Delete all content from kernel-5.15
- cd inside the kernel-5.15
- Clone this repository

```
cd ..
bash ./build_kernel.sh
```

# Thanks to:

AOSP/AOSP devs for system and kernel
Zediss for testing and asking me to do it
